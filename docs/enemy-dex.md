# üìñ Almanac: Enemy Definitions & Design Inspiration

### üêÄ Standard Enemies
- **Trojan Horse:** Malware disguised as legitimate software. *Art: A classic wooden horse sprite with glowing malicious code inside its belly. Modern computer elements like wires or pixels can make it look digital.*
- **Worm:** Self-replicating network malware. *Art: A long, segmented worm sprite made of glowing green data packets or cables. It could have a replication animation.*
- **DDoS Swarm:** A flood of bogus requests from a botnet. *Art: A cloud of small, identical, simplistic robot icons swarming together. Looks overwhelming in large numbers.*
- **Spyware Entity:** Software that secretly steals information. *Art: A sleek, dark, almost invisible sprite with a single large, glowing eye. Looks sneaky and observant.*
- **Adware Bot:** Software that floods users with malicious ads. *Art: A annoying, pop-up style creature with garish colors. Could have flashing "CLICK ME" text or a discount tag.*
- **Keylogger:** malware that records keystrokes. *Art: A sprite that looks like a keyboard key with a sinister eye on it, or a ghostly hand hovering over a keyboard.*

### üìß Mini-Bosses
- **Phishing Attacker:** A hacker who uses deceptive messages. *Art: A shady figure in a digital trench coat holding a fishing rod, but the hook is a fake login window or an email icon.*
- **Rootkit:** Malware that hides deep in system files. *Art: A thorny, root-like creature that looks buried halfway into the floor (the system). Ominous and hard to see clearly.*
- **Insider Threat:** A malicious authorized user. *Art: A person in a standard employee outfit (like a CS student avatar) but with a glitching, sinister expression. Two-faced.*
- **Botnet Commander:** The controller of a zombie computer network. *Art: A larger, more complex bot with antennae, controlling smaller bots with visible strings of light or data.*

### üëë Bosses
- **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts files for ransom. *Art: A large, menacing sprite that looks like a padlock with spider-like legs. It could have encryption algorithms scrolling across its body.*
- **DDoS Boss:** The source of a massive denial-of-service attack. *Art: A giant server rack or a monstrous internet router, firing data packets like projectiles. Looks like a overwhelming fortress.*
- **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):** A sophisticated, stealthy hacker group. *Art: A sleek, high-tech, almost ninja-like figure in dark digital camouflage. Hard to see, with advanced tech visible on its suit.*
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** A hacker who intercepts communications. *Art: A two-faced sprite, or a figure with a large amplifier/radio dish, stealing data streams that are visible between two other points.*
- **SQL Injection:** An attack that exploits database vulnerabilities. *Art: A sprite that looks like a malicious string of code (e.g., `' OR 1=1--`) taking a physical, predatory form. Like a code-snake or a sharp, fragmented entity.*
