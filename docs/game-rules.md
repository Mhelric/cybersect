# 🎯 CyberSect – Game Rules

## 🎮 Core Concept
CyberSect is a single-player, turn-based card game where you play as a cybersecurity student defending your school's network from a hacker. You battle viruses and malware using a deck of cards representing security tools and strategies.

## 📖 Core Loop
1.  Select a chapter (monitor) on the overworld map.
2.  Enter a level and battle enemies using your card deck.
3.  Reduce enemy HP to 0 while protecting your own HP.
4.  Victory rewards Cyber Points (CP) and unlocks new cards/enemy info.
5.  Use CP at the Shop between levels to buy/upgrade cards.
6.  Progress through chapters to unlock new Job Classes.
